"""Reproducible fixed-width non-overlapping consensus ChIP-seq peak set.

Corces et al. 2018 (fixed-width summit windows + score-per-million iterative
overlap removal), with replicate-count-adaptive reproducibility:
  * >=3 reps -> majority vote (summit covered by >= min_reps replicates)
  * ==2 reps -> IDR peaks (precomputed by the reproducible_idr rule)
  * ==1 rep  -> passthrough (flagged; not reproducibility-filtered)
Reproducible peaks are UNIONed across conditions, resized to fixed windows,
blacklist/chrom filtered, and reduced by SPM-ranked iterative overlap removal.

Handles both narrowPeak (10 columns; summit = start + col10 offset) and
broadPeak (9 columns, no summit column; summit = interval midpoint).
