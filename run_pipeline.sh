# Build (once) and run the ChIP-seq Snakemake workflow in Docker.
#
# The workflow is the standard-layout workflow/Snakefile: a single run builds the
# primary pipeline AND the QC report (unified DAG). Pass extra snakemake args
# (cores, a target, -n, ...) through to the container.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_pipeline.sh                          # everything (primary → QC), 4 cores
#   ./run_pipeline.sh --cores 16               # everything, 16 cores
#   ./run_pipeline.sh --cores 16 chipseq_all   # primary pipeline only
#   ./run_pipeline.sh --cores 16 qc_all        # QC only (after primary)
#   ./run_pipeline.sh -n                        # dry run: check the DAG first
#
# The current directory (code + ref/ genomes + data/ FASTQs) is mounted at
# /workflow; results/ are written back here. The pre-built conda envs live in the
# image at /opt/wf-conda and are reused via --conda-prefix. The image ENTRYPOINT
# runs `snakemake -s workflow/Snakefile --use-conda ...`.
